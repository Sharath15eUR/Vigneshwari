Scanning process:
-> It is process to find whether the AP's are in the range of connectivity or not.
-> Purpose:
a. Discover available networks (SSIDs)
b. Gather information like channel, signal strength, capabilities.
c. Decide which AP to associate with.
-> There are two methods to perform Wi-Fi scanning, which are:
a. Active scannng
b.Passive scanning

-> Active scanning:
a. The station sends Probe Request frames on different channels.
b. APs respond with Probe Response frames.
c. Initiated by the client device (STA).
d. Faster network discovery.
e. Can detect hidden SSIDs (if SSID is included in the request).
f. Consumes more power (due to transmission).
g. Adds extra traffic to the wireless medium.
h. Commonly used during roaming or initial quick connection setup.

-> Passive Scanning
a. The station listens for periodic Beacon frames broadcast by APs.
b. No transmission from the STA.
c.  Initiated by the client device but remains silent.
d. Slower than active scanning (must wait for beacons).
e.Cannot detect hidden SSIDs (since they are not broadcast).
f. Consumes less power.
g. No extra traffic on the network.
h.Useful in power-saving situations or regulated environments.
