MAC methodologies:
-> Medium Access Control (MAC) is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model.
-> Its primary role is to regulate how multiple devices share the communication medium and avoid collisions or data corruption.

Methodologies:
1. Random Access (Contention-Based) :
-> Devices compete to access the communication medium. 
-> This method is used when network traffic is unpredictable.
->  CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) 
* Used in Ethernet networks. Devices listen to the medium before transmitting. 
* If two devices transmit at the same time, causing a collision, they detect it and then wait for a random period before trying again.
* This method is efficient in wired networks but not ideal for wireless environments.
-> CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) 
* Used in Wi-Fi networks. 
* Devices check if the medium is clear before transmitting.
* It employs acknowledgments (ACKs), Request to Send (RTS), and Clear to Send (CTS) signals to reduce the likelihood of collisions.
* It’s commonly used in wireless networks where collision detection isn’t feasible.

2. Controlled Access (Deterministic Access) 
-> Access to the communication medium is regulated, ensuring no collisions.
-> Polling 
* A central controller, such as an access point (AP) or base station, asks each device if it has data to send. 
* Devices can only transmit when requested.
* While this method is predictable, it can introduce delays and overhead.
-> Token Passing 
* A special data packet, called a token, circulates through the network. 
* Only the device holding the token is allowed to transmit.
* This method is used in Token Ring and FDDI networks, though it is rarely used today.

3. Channelization (Multiplexing-Based Access)
-> The medium is divided into separate logical channels, and each device is assigned its own segment.
-> FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) 
* The frequency spectrum is split into smaller sub-channels, with each device allocated a specific frequency.
* This method is commonly used in older cellular and satellite systems.
-> TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) 
* Time is divided into slots, and devices take turns transmitting during their designated time slots. 
* This method is used in technologies like GSM and Bluetooth.
-> CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 
* Devices transmit simultaneously on the same frequency, but each uses a unique code to differentiate the signals. 
* This approach is used in 3G cellular networks.
