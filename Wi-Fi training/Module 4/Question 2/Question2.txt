MAC frame:
-> The MAC layer frame consists of 9 fields.
1. Frame Control (FC)
The Frame Control field is 2 bytes long and provides essential control information, including the frame’s type. It includes several subfields:
a. Version (2 bits): Indicates the protocol version, currently fixed at 0.
b. Type (2 bits): Specifies the primary purpose of the frame—whether it's a management (00), control (01), or data (10) frame. The value 11 is reserved for future use.
c. Subtype (4 bits): Defines the specific kind of frame, e.g., 0000 for an association request or 1000 for a beacon.
d. To DS (1 bit): Set to 1 if the frame is destined for the distribution system (DS).
e. From DS (1 bit): Set to 1 if the frame originates from the distribution system.
f. More Fragments (1 bit): When set, it indicates that additional fragments will follow this frame.
g. Retry (1 bit): Used to indicate that the current frame is a retransmission of a previously sent frame.
h. Power Management (1 bit): Tells whether the station will enter power-saving mode after this transmission. A value of 1 means power-saving mode; 0 means it stays active.
i. More Data (1 bit): Informs the recipient that more frames are waiting. Access points can use this to notify sleeping stations that additional data is buffered.
j. WEP (1 bit): Indicates if 802.11 encryption (WEP) is enabled for this frame.
k. Order (1 bit): If set, the receiver must process frames strictly in the order they arrive.

2. Duration/ID
This 4-byte field (sometimes referred to as 2 bytes depending on context) specifies how long the channel will be reserved for this transmission, measured in microseconds (µs).

3. Address Fields (Address 1–4)
Each address field is 6 bytes (48 bits) and stores standard IEEE MAC addresses. The specific meaning of each address depends on the To DS and From DS flags in the Frame Control field.

4. Sequence Control (SC)
A 16-bit field divided into:
a. Sequence Number (12 bits): Helps identify and order frames.
b. Fragment Number (4 bits): Used for reassembling frames split into fragments.
This field ensures reliable delivery by identifying duplicates and assisting in frame reordering.

5. Data
A variable-length section containing the actual payload or information being sent. Its content depends on the frame subtype and is passed transparently from sender to receiver.

6. CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
A 4-byte field holding a 32-bit checksum used for detecting errors during transmission. It ensures the integrity of the frame upon arrival.
