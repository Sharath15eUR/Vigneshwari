MAC : 
-> MAC is a sublayer of the data link layer of the OSI reference model for data transmission.
-> It is responsible for flow control and multiplexing for transmission medium.
-> It controls the transmission of data packets via remotely shared channels. 
-> It sends data over the network interface card.

Significance:
-> Determines who gets to transmit data over the shared communication medium (like Ethernet or Wi-Fi). Thus , it avoids collision.
-> It helps in data framing and adds MAC addresses for source and destination.
-> Uses MAC addresses to identify devices on the same network segment.
-> Adds error-checking data (like CRC) to detect transmission errors.
-> Ensures Coordination on Shared Media

Exampls:
-> Ethernet
-> Wi-Fi (802.11)
-> Bluetooth
