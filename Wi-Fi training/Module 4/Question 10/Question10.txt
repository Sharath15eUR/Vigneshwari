-> The terms A-MSDU, A-MPDU, and A-MSDU in A-MPDU relate to the packaging and transmission of data in the MAC layer. 

1. A-MSDU (Aggregated MAC Service Data Units)
Definiton: 
-> A-MSDU aggregates multiple MAC Service Data Units (MSDUs) into one larger frame.
-> An MSDU is the packet passed from upper layers (like IP or TCP) to the MAC layer for delivery.
Structure:
-> Multiple MSDUs are bundled into a single frame that shares one MAC header and one frame control field.
-> Each MSDU remains separate, and they can belong to different traffic sessions.
Advantages: 
-> This method reduces protocol overhead by eliminating the need for multiple headers, resulting in more efficient data transmission.

2. A-MPDU (Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Units)
Definition: 
-> A-MPDU aggregates several MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) into a single transmission.
-> An MPDU contains both the MAC header and the actual data being sent.
Structure:
-> Each MPDU in the A-MPDU bundle retains its own MAC header and is sent together within one physical transmission.
-> Because of this, each MPDU can be separately acknowledged by the receiver.
Advantages:
-> It improves throughput by sending multiple MPDUs in one go, reducing the number of transmissions and lowering communication overhead.

3. A-MSDU within A-MPDU
Definition: 
-> This technique merges the benefits of both A-MSDU and A-MPDU.
-> Here, several A-MSDUs—each containing multiple MSDUs—are grouped together into a single A-MPDU frame.
Structure: 
-> Each A-MSDU, made up of multiple MSDUs, is encapsulated as an individual unit within an A-MPDU. 
-> The result is a highly efficient packaging of data for transmission.
Advantages:
-> By using both types of aggregation, this method maximizes data throughput and minimizes protocol overhead, optimizing the use of wireless bandwidth and reducing transmission delays.
