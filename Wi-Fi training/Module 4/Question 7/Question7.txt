Power saving mode:
-> The Power Saving mechanism in the MAC layer allows a station (STA) to reduce energy consumption by switching between:
  a. Active Mode – fully powered and able to send/receive.
  b. Sleep Mode (Doze) – shuts down the radio to save power when not actively communicating.

Process:
-> A station informs the AP that it’s entering power-saving mode by setting the Power Management bit in its frame.
-> The AP begins buffering any incoming frames meant for that STA.
-> Beacon frames, which the AP sends at regular intervals, include a Traffic Indication Map (TIM).
-> The TIM shows which STAs have pending data at the AP.
-> The STA periodically wakes up to check these beacon frames.
-> If its Association ID (AID) appears in the TIM:
-> It sends a PS-Poll frame to request the data.
-> The AP transmits the buffered frame and, if additional frames are pending, sets the More Data bit.

Types:
1. Legacy Power Save Mode (802.11)
-> The STA sleeps and periodically wakes to listen to TIMs in beacon frames.
-> It requests buffered data using PS-Poll.
-> This method is simple but can introduce delays and inefficiency when multiple frames are involved.

2. Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD)
-> Part of Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) enhancements.
-> Common in voice and video applications.
-> The STA initiates delivery by sending an uplink frame.
-> The AP responds by delivering all queued packets, eliminating the need for PS-Poll.
-> Improves responsiveness and conserves energy for real-time traffic.

3. Scheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (S-APSD)
-> Also part of WMM Power Save.
-> The STA and AP agree on predefined delivery times.
-> The AP transmits buffered data automatically at those intervals.
-> Ideal for predictable and periodic traffic.

4. Target Wake Time (TWT) – 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
-> The STA and AP negotiate specific wake-up times.
-> The STA sleeps and only wakes during those agreed TWT intervals.
-> Greatly reduces power usage and channel contention.
-> Especially useful for IoT devices and environments with many clients.

5. Listen Interval (Infrastructure Mode)
-> The STA tells the AP how often it plans to wake up to receive beacons.
-> The AP buffers data until that time.
->Helps the STA conserve battery without missing important data.
