Client association process:
-> The association process is how a client device (STA) connects to a Wi-Fi network through an AP. 
-> It typically follows these three main steps:
a. Scanning
b. Authentication
c. Association

 1. Scanning (Discovery Phase)
-> The client searches for available networks using:
a. Passive Scanning – listens for beacon frames.
b. Active Scanning – sends probe requests.
-> Gathers information like SSID, signal strength, supported rates, and security settings.

2. Authentication
-> The client sends an authentication request to the AP.
-> The AP responds with an authentication response.
-> In open system authentication, this step is a formality (no password exchange yet).
-> In shared key authentication, a challenge-response mechanism is used (older WEP-based).

3. Association
-> After successful authentication, the client sends an association request.
-> Includes supported data rates, capabilities, and SSID.
-> The AP replies with an association response (success or failure).

4. 4- way handshake
-> Happens if the network uses WPA/WPA2/WPA3 security.
-> Exchanges keys to establish an encrypted connection.

Once associated, the client is logically connected to the AP.
