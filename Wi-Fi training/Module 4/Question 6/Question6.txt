EAPOL 4-way handshake:
-> The EAPOL 4-Way Handshake is a critical security mechanism used in WPA/WPA2/WPA3 networks to establish a secure communication channel between a client (STA) and an AP.
-> Confirms both client and AP know the PMK (Pairwise Master Key).
-> Derives keys used for encrypting data (PTK, GTK).
-> Prevents replay attacks.
-> Establishes secure wireless communication.

Process:
1. AP → STA
-> Message: ANonce
-> The AP sends a nonce (a random number), called ANonce, to the client.
-> Purpose: Start the handshake and provide material to derive encryption keys.

2. STA → AP
-> Message: SNonce + MIC
-> The client:
   a. Generates its own random number (SNonce).
   b. Combines ANonce + SNonce + MAC addresses + PMK to derive PTK (Pairwise Transient Key).
   c. Sends SNonce and a MIC (Message Integrity Code) calculated using the PTK.
-> Purpose: Show that the client has the PMK and derive encryption keys securely.

3. AP → STA
-> Message: GTK + MIC
->The AP:
   a. Uses the same info to derive the PTK.
   b. Encrypts and sends the Group Temporal Key (GTK) using part of the PTK.
   c. Includes a MIC to prove it has the correct PTK.
-> Purpose: Deliver the group key (GTK) securely to the client.

4. STA → AP
-> Message: Acknowledgement
-> The client sends a final ACK with a MIC.
->  Purpose: Confirms that the GTK was successfully received and handshake completed.

Keys :
-> PMK (Pairwise Master Key) :	Shared secret generated from the pre-shared key (PSK) or EAP-based authentication.
-> PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) : 	Key used for securing unicast traffic; derived from PMK, ANonce, SNonce, and MAC addresses.
-> GTK (Group Temporal Key) : 	Used for encrypting broadcast/multicast traffic; shared with all clients by the AP.
-> MIC (Message Integrity Code) :	Ensures message authenticity and integrity in handshake frames.
