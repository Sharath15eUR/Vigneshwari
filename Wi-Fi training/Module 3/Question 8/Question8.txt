OFDM vs OFDMA:

OFDM:
->Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
->Used in Wi-Fi 4/5 (802.11a/g/n/ac)
->Splits the channel into many subcarriers.
->All subcarriers are used to serve one user at a time.
->Designed for single-user transmission.
->Higher latency in multi-user environments.
->Works well for large data transfers (e.g., video, downloads).
->Less efficient in high-density networks.
->Cannot allocate parts of the channel to different users simultaneously.

OFDMA:
->Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
->Introduced in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)
->Splits the channel into subcarriers and groups them into Resource Units (RUs).
->Allows multiple users to transmit/receive simultaneously using different RUs.
->Designed for multi-user environments.
->Lower latency, especially with small data packets.
->Ideal for high-density deployments and IoT devices.
->More efficient channel utilization.
->Greatly improves performance in crowded networks (e.g., schools, airports, stadiums).
