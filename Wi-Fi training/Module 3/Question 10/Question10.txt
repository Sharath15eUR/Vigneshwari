1. PPDU :
-> PLCP Protocol Data Unit
-> The actual frame transmitted over the air at the PHY layer.
-> It contains:
      a.The PLCP preamble (for sync & channel estimation),
      b.The PLCP header (info about the frame),
      c.the PSDU (the MAC layer data payload).
-> It is the complete package that includes instructions + data.

2. PLCP :
-> Physical Layer Convergence Protocol
-> It's a sublayer of the PHY layer.
-> It is Responsible for:
     a. Converting the MAC frame into the PPDU.
     b.Adding the preamble and PHY header.
     c.Helps the receiving station synchronize and understand how to decode the incoming data.

3. PMD :
-> Physical Medium Dependent
-> This is the lowest part of the PHY layer.
-> Handles the actual transmission and reception of radio signals.
->Converts digital data into radio waves (modulation) and vice versa (demodulation).
-> Deals with:
       Frequency,Modulation types,Signal power, antenna functions, etc.
