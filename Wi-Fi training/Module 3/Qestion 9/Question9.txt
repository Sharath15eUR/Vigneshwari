MIMO Vs MU-MIMO:

MIMO:
-> Multiple Input, Multiple Output
-> Used in Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) and above
-> Uses multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver.
-> Increases data rates by transmitting multiple data streams to one device at a time.
-> Helps improve signal strength and reliability through spatial diversity.
-> Single-user technology â€” one device receives multiple streams at once.
-> Cannot send data to multiple clients simultaneously.
-> Boosts throughput for one user.

MU-MIMO:
-> Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output
-> Introduced in Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Improved in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)
-> Also uses multiple antennas, but serves multiple devices at the same time.
-> Enables parallel data streams to different users simultaneously.
-> Greatly improves network efficiency and capacity.
-> Supports downlink in Wi-Fi 5, and both uplink & downlink in Wi-Fi 6.
-> Ideal for environments with many connected devices.
->Reduces wait time for each client, especially in busy networks.
