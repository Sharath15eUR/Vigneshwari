Frequency band:
-> These determines specific range of electromagnetic frequencies used in wireless communication.
-> These allow devieces to connect to the internet without the physical cables , ensuring seamless rmobility.
-> Wifi frequency bands re very crucila in determining how wireless n/w operates , its connection , speed and range.
-> In wifi we have primarily 2 frequency bands which are 
       a. 2.4 GHz
       b. 5 GHz


2.4GHz:
-> Longere range , better penetration througthrough the walls.
-> Slower speeds - upto 600 MBps.
-> Higher vulnerable to interfernce.
-> has only fewer non -overlapping channels.
-> use cases: IoT devices , browsing.

5GHz:
->Shorter range, less penetration.
-> Higher speeds - upto 1300 Mbps or more .
-> Less prone to interference.
-> has large number of non- overlapping channels.
-> use cases : Streaming high definition videos , online gaming etc.
