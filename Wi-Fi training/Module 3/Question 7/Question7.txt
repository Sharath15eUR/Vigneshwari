 802.11 PHY layer frame :
-> The PHY layer frame  is also called the PPDU — PLCP Protocol Data Unit.
-> It wraps around the MAC layer frame and adds key transmission instructions.

Key Components of a PHY Layer Frame: 
 1. Preamble : 
->Like a "heads up" — tells the receiver, “Incoming signal!”
->Helps the receiver detect and synchronize with the signal. It includes:
    - Synchronization bits
    - Training sequences to lock timing and frequency.

2. PLCP Header:
->Like a cover page — explains how to read the data that follows.
->Tells the receiver how to decode the frame. Contains:
     - Data rate
     - Length of payload
     - Modulation type
     - Coding scheme

3. PSDU (Payload)	:
->The actual message you’re sending.
->This is the actual data from the MAC layer (MAC frame).
->It includes: addresses, sequence number, data, etc.

4. Tail / Padding:	
->Ensures the signal ends cleanly or aligns with encoding.
->Used for alignment or completing final encoding blocks.
