DSSS :
-> DSSS, or Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, is a wireless data transmission method that involves spreading the signal across a wide range of frequencies using a spreading code.
-> Before transmission, the spreading code is combined with the data signal, and the receiver uses the same code to extract the original data signal.
-> The DSSS spreading code is typically a long, complex sequence of 1s and 0s generated by a mathematical algorithm.
-> This sequence is combined with the original data signal via a process known as "chipping," which involves multiplying each bit of the data signal by a corresponding bit from the spreading code. 
-> it is more resistant to interference and noise.
-> The spreading code is used at the receiver to "de-chip" the signal and extract the original data signal. 
-> The receiver must be synchronized with the transmitter at all times so that it knows which spreading code is being used.
-> Since, the original data signal is reconstructed from multiple bits of the spreading code, some parts of the signal can be lost while the overall transmission remains unaffected.

FHSS:
-> Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, is a wireless data transmission method that involves constantly changing the frequency of the transmitted signal across a wide frequency range. 
-> This is accomplished by segmenting the frequency spectrum into multiple channels and rapidly switching between them at regular intervals. 
-> The transmitter and receiver are synchronized so that they both know which frequency is currently in use.
-> FHSS signals cause little interference in narrowband communications.
-> FHSS's frequency hopping pattern is typically pseudorandom, which means it appears random but is actually determined by a mathematical algorithm. 
-> This reduces the possibility of unauthorized users intercepting or jamming the signal.
-> It is used in different applications such as wireless LANs, wireless sensors, and military communications.
