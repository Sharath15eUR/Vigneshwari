Role of Guard Intervals in WLAN Transmission :
-> A Guard Interval is a small time gap inserted between transmitted data symbols in a Wi-Fi transmission.
-> Its main purpose is to prevent inter-symbol interference (ISI) — which occurs when delayed echoes (multipath reflections) from one symbol interfere with the next.

Need:
->In real-world wireless environments (e.g., homes, offices, campuses), signals bounce off walls and objects. These echoes can overlap with the next symbol, causing data errors.
-> The Guard Interval absorbs these echoes, giving time for the signal to settle before the next symbol starts.

Types:
GI Type	             Duration	                  Used In
Long GI           	  800 ns	           Default in 802.11a/g/n/ac
Short GI (SGI) 	      400 ns	           Optional in 802.11n/ac/ax

How Short Guard Interval Improves Efficiency?
->Good signal quality.
->Low multipath interference.
->Short to moderate distance from AP.
->Reduces wasted time between symbols.
->Increases the number of symbols transmitted per second.
-> Leads to ~10–11% throughput improvement.
 
example: 
-> Each OFDM symbol consists of:
            Data part: 3.2µs
            Guard Interval (GI): 0.8 µs or 0.4 µs
So total time per symbol is:
 
GI Type	          Symbol Time (µs)
Long GI       	3.2 + 0.8 = 4.0 µs
Short GI	      3.2 + 0.4 = 3.6 µs 
So, each symbol takes less time with short GI.Thus, higher speed.
