PPDU (Physical Layer Protocol Data Unit):

-> The PPDU is the complete frame sent over the air by the PHY layer in a Wi-Fi transmission.
-> It includes everything needed for a receiving device to successfully synchronize, decode, and interpret the signal.

General PPDU Structure:  
-> A typical PPDU consists of:
a.Preamble – Used for synchronization and to help the receiver estimate the channel.
b.PHY Header – Contains control information that helps in decoding.
c.PSDU (Payload) – The actual data coming from the MAC layer.

Types of PPDUs Across Wi-Fi Standards:
-> Legacy PPDU (802.11a/b/g)
   a. Used in early Wi-Fi versions.
   b.Simple structure: preamble, header, and data.
   c.Designed for single-user communication only.
   d.Lower efficiency and no support for modern features like MIMO or wider channels.

->HT PPDU (High Throughput – 802.11n / Wi-Fi 4)
    a.Introduced MIMO, enabling multiple parallel data streams.
    b.Supports 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels.
    c.Includes HT-SIG fields to describe MIMO configuration.
    d.Can use shorter guard intervals (400 ns) to improve throughput.

-> VHT PPDU (Very High Throughput – 802.11ac / Wi-Fi 5)
    a. Adds support for MU-MIMO and channel widths up to 160 MHz.
    b. Includes VHT-SIG-A and VHT-SIG-B fields with more detailed modulation and user-specific data.
    c. Uses 256-QAM for faster data rates.
    d.  Much more efficient than HT, especially for multiple users.

-> HE PPDU (High Efficiency – 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6/6E)
    a. Designed to handle dense environments with many devices.
    b.Supports advanced features like OFDMA, BSS coloring, Target Wake Time (TWT), and UL/DL MU-MIMO.
    c.Comes in several formats:
           HE SU PPDU – for single-user transmission.
           HE MU PPDU – for multi-user scenarios.
           HE TB PPDU – for random uplink access.
           HE ER PPDU – for long-distance coverage (extended range).
   d.Contains HE-SIG-A and HE-SIG-B to convey complex configuration info.
