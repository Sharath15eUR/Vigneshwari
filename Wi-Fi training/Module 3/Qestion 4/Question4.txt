OFDM:
-> OFDM stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing .
-> it’s one of the key technologies behind modern Wi-Fi (used in standards like 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax).
-> It plays a critical role in improving speed, reliability, and efficiency of wireless communication.

Working:
-> Instead of sending all data on one high-speed channel ,OFDM splits the data into multiple slower parallel streams, each sent on its own narrow subcarrier, which are as follows:
     a.Orthogonal (mathematically spaced to avoid interference)
     b.Sent simultaneously
     c.Each modulated with BPSK, QPSK, or QAM

How OFDM Improves WLAN Performance:
-> OFDM handles reflections  well, which is common in indoors.
-> It allows parallel data transmission using many subcarriers — boosting throughput.
-> Subcarriers are tightly packed with no overlap , maximizing use of bandwidth.
-> Supports forward error correction (FEC) to recover from transmission errors.
->Can operate well even in noisy or interference-prone environments.

Example:
-> In 802.11a/g/n:
  OFDM uses 64 subcarriers (48 for data, 4 for pilot, rest for guard bands)
  Each subcarrier carries its own modulated data stream. This allows even small chunks of the signal to be decoded, improving reliability.
