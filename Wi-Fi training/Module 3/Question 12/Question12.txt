Data rate:
-> The data rate  refers to the speed at which data is transmitted over the network. 
->It’s typically measured in Mbps or Gbps . 
->In  Wi-Fi, it depends upon several factors like:
            a. modulation scheme, 
            b.channel width
            c.number of spatial streams
            d.and coding rate

Formula:
  Data Rate=(Modulation Rate)×(Number of Spatial Streams)×(Channel Width)×(Coding Rate)

Where ,

-> Modulation determines how many bits are carried by each symbol( ex: BPSK -1 bit , QPSK -2 bits etc.)
-> multiple data streams to be sent simultaneously and each stream can carry independent data. (Ex: 1 stream: Data is sent to/from one antenna & 2 streams: Data is sent to/from two antennas, doubling the rate)
->The width of the channel determines the number of subcarriers available for transmission.(ex: 20 MHz , 40MHz etc.)
-> Coding Rate refers to the error correction applied to the transmission and is  represented as a ratio.(Ex: 1/2: 50% of the data is used for error correction.)
