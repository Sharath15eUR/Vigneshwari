CAPWAP:
-> CAPWAP stands for Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points.
-> It is a standardized protocol defined by the IETF (RFC 5415) that enables centralized control of wireless networks.
->It facilitates communication between Lightweight Access Points (LWAPs) and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
->CAPWAP encapsulates both control and data messages between APs and controllers, allowing for centralized management and configuration of APs.

Features:
->Supports SplitMAC architecture.
->Separates Control Plane and Data Plane.
->Works over IP networks using UDP ports 5246 (Control) and 5247 (Data).

Flow Between AP and Controller:
1. Discovery Phase: 
The AP powers up and looks for a WLC.AP sends a Discovery Request to the controller.
2. Join Phase:
The WLC responds with a Discovery Response.AP selects a WLC and sends a Join Request.WLC replies with a Join Response, and the CAPWAP tunnel is established.
3. Image Download :
If the APâ€™s software version is not compatible, the WLC pushes the correct image to the AP.
4. Configuration
Once joined, the WLC pushes configuration settings (SSIDs, security policies, etc.) to the AP.
5. Operational Phase
The AP is now operational.CAPWAP Data Tunnel carries user data from AP to WLC.

Representation:
[AP] ---> Discovery Request ---> [WLC]
[WLC] ---> Discovery Response ---> [AP]
[AP] ---> Join Request ---> [WLC]
[WLC] ---> Join Response ---> [AP]
[WLC] ---> (optional) Image Download ---> [AP]
[WLC] ---> Configuration Push ---> [AP]
[AP] <--> Control & Data Tunnels <--> [WLC]
