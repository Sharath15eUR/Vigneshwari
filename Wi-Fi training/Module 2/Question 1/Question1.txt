Split MAC:
-> SplitMAC architecture is a tuype od architecture in  wireless networks, particularly in enterprise Wi-Fi systems, where the Media Access Control (MAC) layer functionality is split between two devices,which are:
a. Access Point (AP) – the hardware device that connects wireless clients to the network.The AP handles real-time MAC functions.
b.Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) – a centralized control unit that manages multiple APs.The WLC takes care of higher-level MAC functions

-> Responsiblities of AP:
a.Frame acknowledgment
b.Retransmissions
c.Encryption/decryption
d.Packet buffering

-> Responsiblities of WLC:
a.Authentication
b.Association and roaming decisions
c.Load balancing
d.RF management and channel selection

->SplitMAC improves AP performance by:
a.Configuration, updates, and policy enforcement are done at the controller level, reducing overhead on the AP and simplifying network management.
b.Improved Roaming as the WLC manages seamless handoffs between APs and therfore reducing packet loss and latency.
c.SplitMAC allows better scalability in large deployments since APs remain lightweight and the controller can manage hundreds of APs efficiently.
