Lightweight Access Points (APs) and Cloud-based Access Points are both types of wireless APs used in enterprise networks.The differences between them are: 

LWAP:
-> Controlled by a centralized Wireless LAN Controller.
-> Security, configuration, firmware updates resides in the controller. The AP just forwards data and control messages.
-> Requires on-premise hardware controller for deployment.
-> Highly scalable, but complex.
-> Internet cnnectivity not required for management.
-> Typically used in large enterprise environments with many APs and a need for centralized control.

Cloud AP:
-> Managed through a cloud controller.
-> APs connect to and get configurations from the cloud. No on-premise controller needed.
-> No need for physical controllers.
-> Very scalable and simple.
-> Required internet for full functionality.
-> Ideal for distributed networks or organizations with multiple remote locations.
