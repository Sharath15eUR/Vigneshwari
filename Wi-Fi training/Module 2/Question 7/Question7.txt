-> If the WLC is deployed over a WAN, the best AP mode to use for the local network is FlexConnect Mode.
-> FlexConnect allows an AP to maintain local switching and limited autonomy even when the WLC is located remotely .

Why?
-> Local switching:
a.The AP can switch client traffic locally, directly into the local VLAN, instead of tunneling it back to the WLC over the WAN.
b.This greatly reduces WAN bandwidth usage, especially for data-heavy applications.

-> Continuous operation:
a.If the WAN connection to the WLC fails, the AP can continue to maintain wireless service for clients.
b.This is called " FlexConnect standalone operation".

->Centralised anagement:
a. While data stays local, control and configuration are still managed centrally through the WLC.
b.This provides a balance of central control and local efficiency.
