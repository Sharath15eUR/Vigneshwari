Issues:
-> Poor management capablity:
a.Each AP must be configured, monitored, and updated manually.
b.Tedious and time-consuming to manage settings across 50+ devices.
For example:If you need to change the SSID or security settings, you'd have to log into every AP individually.

-> Configuration mismatches:
a. Risk of configuration mismatches between APs (e.g., SSIDs, VLANs, security) which can lead to user confusion, roaming issues, or security gaps.

-> Scalability Issues:
a. As the number of APs grows, the complexity and chance of mismanagement increases.
b. Autonomous mode is not designed for large, dynamic environments.

-> Issues in roaming:
a. Without coordination, APs can't manage fast or seamless client roaming.
b. Users may experience disconnections or lag when moving between lecture halls or buildings.
For example:A student walking from the library to a classroom may get dropped and need to reconnect manually.
