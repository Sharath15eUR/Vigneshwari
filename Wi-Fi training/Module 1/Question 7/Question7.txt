-> Since , I donot own a wifi router , I have changed the hotspot setting of my mobile to 2.4GHz bandwidth and connected it to the laptop.
-> I used the command 
  netsh wlan show interfaces
on my laptop to check for the properties.
-> I have comapred the results obtained by connecting with 2.4GHz and 5GHz :
a. Wi-Fi Standard	: 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)	- 2.4GHz
                  802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) -5 GHz     
  result : 5 GHz supports a newer, faster standard.

b. Channel  : 	1 - 2.4GHz	
                36 - 5GHz 
result: 5 GHz operates on higher, less crowded channels.

c. Band	: 2.4 GHz has better range, but 5 GHz has higher speed

d. Receive Speed : 	72.2 Mbps - 2.4GHz
                  433.3 Mbps - 5GHz 	
result : 5 GHz is 6x faster here.

e. Transmit Speed : 	72.2 Mbps	- 2.4 GHz
                      26 Mbps - 5GHz	
result : Unstable transmit rate on 5 GHz 

f.Signal Strength	: 92% - 2.4GHz
                    87%	- 5GHz 
result : 2.4 GHz has a slightly stronger signal

g. Interference : 	More (crowded band) - 2.4 GHz
                    Less (cleaner band) - 5GHz
result: 2.4 GHz faces interference from Bluetooth, microwaves, etc.
