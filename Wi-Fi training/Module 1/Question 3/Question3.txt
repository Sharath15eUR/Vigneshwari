IEEE 802.11 defines two types of services:
       1. Basic Service Set (BSS)
       2. Extended Service set(ESS)

BSS:
->It is the building block of wireless LAN.
->BSS is basically a network topology that allows all wireless devices to communicate with each other through a common medium i.e., AP (Access point)
->here, one AP connects all the stations. Thus it is not mobile.
->In BSS, stations or devices do not communicate directly with each other . AP is required that acts as a medium.
->It provides short range wireless communication and the area it covers is known as BSA(Basic service area).
-> Each BSS is uniquely identified using an ID called BSSID (Basic service set identifier). This BSSID is the MAC address of AP associated with BSS.
-> It is mainly used in home or small offices.

ESS:
->It conists ofmore than one BSS that are interconnected with each other.
->ALL APs in ESS are connected to each other by a common DS (Distribution System). With the help of DS, more than one AP can get connected to the same LAN. 
->Here ,all APs work together to create a long range wireless network like an entire building coverage.
->Area that is being covered by ESS is known as ESA (Extended Service Area).
->It supports mobility as more than one AP is present.Whenever user moves from one area to another, it will jump from one AP to another.This is known as roaming.
->ESS provide better strength and boost signal all over wireless network.
->It is mainly used for large areas like an entire building etc.
