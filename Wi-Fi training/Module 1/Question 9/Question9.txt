A Wi-Fi backhaul refers to the method used to connect an access point (AP) or router to the main internet source. There are different types based on the medium used:
                    1.Wired backhaul (Most Reliable & High-Speed)
                    2. Wireless backhaul (Flexible but May Have Higher Latency)
                    3. Hybrid backhaul
Examples of backhauls are :
-> Fibre optics
-> Ethernet (Copper cables)
-> Satellite backhaul
-> Cellular (4G/5G) Backhaul
-> PLC (Power line communication ) backhaul

Our college uses fibre optics for communication, some of the key propoerties includes:
-> Technology Used: Optical fiber cables (light transmission)
-> Speed: Can range from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps (Not sure about the range )
-> Latency: Very low 
->  Reliability: Extremely high
-> Distance Coverage: Can transmit data over the entire campus
