Depending on how devices and access points communicate , there are varous toplogies, which are as follows :

-> Infrastructure mode (Star topology)
Devices connect to a central AP , which is wired to the main network.
It includes BSS, ESS and DS.
Use cases:  Home and office Wi-Fi networks , Public hotspots (eg., cafe etc)

->Ad-Hoc Mode (Mesh-Like)
Devices communicate directly with each other without an access point and thus called peer-to-peer connection.
Use cases: File sharing b/w laptops (temporary sharing).

-> Mesh topology 
Multiple Wi-Fi nodes connect to each other dynamically, creating a self-healing and extended coverage network.
Use cases: Smart cities and IoT networks 

-> Wireless Distribution System (WDS)
 APs are wirelessly linked to extend network coverage without requiring Ethernet cables.
Use cases: Outdoor campus networks , connecting separate buildings.

-> Point-to-Point (PtP) and Point-to-Multipoint (PtMP)
Uses directional antennas to connect one location to another (PtP) or one location to many (PtMP).
Use cases: Long-distance wireless backhaul .
