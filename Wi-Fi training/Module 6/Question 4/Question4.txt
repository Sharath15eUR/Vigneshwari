4. Why is WEP considered insecure compared to WPA2 or WPA3?
-> WEP is considered insecure because of the following reasons: 
-> It uses weak encryption that can be easily cracked.
-> The initialization vector (IV) is short, causing patterns to repeat, which makes it easier for hackers to guess the key.
-> WEP doesnâ€™t properly verify if the data was altered during transmission.
-> The same key is used for a long time, making it more vulnerable to attacks.
-> Hackers can crack WEP in just minutes using free tools.
-> In contrast, WPA2 and WPA3 use stronger encryption (AES) and offer better security features, making them much safer than WEP.
