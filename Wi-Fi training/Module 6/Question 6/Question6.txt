6. What is the role of the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in the 4-way handshake?
-> Role in the 4-Way Handshake:
The PMK is used to generate the Pairwise Transient Keys (PTK), which are the actual keys used to encrypt the data between the client  and the Aduring the session.

-> Generation of PMK:
The PMK is derived from the Wi-Fi password (pre-shared key or PSK) and the MAC addresses of the client and AP. Itâ€™s a long-term key that both the AP and device know in advance.

-> 4-Way Handshake:
During the handshake, the PMK is used in the following steps:
a. The AP and client exchange messages to confirm they both have the same PMK.
b. They use the PMK to create new, temporary encryption keys (the PTK) for securing the data exchange.
c. The handshake ensures both sides have the correct keys and can start encrypting and decrypting the data securely.

-> Security:
The PMK itself is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the 4-way handshake verifies that both the client and AP have the correct PMK and can securely generate the encryption keys needed for the session.
