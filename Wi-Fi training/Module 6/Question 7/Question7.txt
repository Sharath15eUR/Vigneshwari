7. How does the 4-way handshake ensure mutual authentication between the client and the access point?
-> The 4-way handshake ensures that both the client and AP are authenticated by doing the following:

a. Both the client and the AP already share a Pairwise Master Key (PMK), which they both know.
b. During the handshake, they each send a random number (called a nonce – ANonce from the AP and SNonce from the client).
c. They then use the PMK, these random numbers, and their MAC addresses to create a new key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK).
d. Both sides calculate the PTK separately. If they both get the same PTK, it means they both have the correct PMK.
e. The AP sends a message that’s encrypted with this new key, and the client has to respond correctly.
f. If both the AP and client respond correctly, it proves they both know the PMK, but it’s never actually shared over the network.
g. This process ensures that both the client and AP are authenticated, and they can now set up a secure, encrypted connection.
