1. Pillars of wifi security:
-> Encryption:
This makes sure that the data you send over Wi-Fi is hidden and unreadable to anyone who shouldn’t see it.
-> Authentication:
This checks that only trusted devices or users can connect to your network.
-> Access Control:
This limits who can connect to your Wi-Fi by setting rules on who gets access.
-> Integrity:
This makes sure the data sent over the network isn’t changed or tampered with during transmission.
