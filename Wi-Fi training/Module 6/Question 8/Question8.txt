8. What will happen if we put a wrong passphrase during a 4 - way handshake?
-> If the wrong passphrase is entered during the 4-way handshake:
a. The client and access point will generate different Pairwise Master Keys (PMKs).
b. Since the PMKs don't match, the Pairwise Transient Keys (PTKs) created during the handshake won’t be the same.
c. The handshake messages will fail because the encryption won’t work properly.
d. As a result, the connection won’t be established, and the client won’t be able to join the Wi-Fi network.
