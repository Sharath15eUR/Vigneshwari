Key features of Wi Fi 6, 6E, and 7 vs. Wi Fi 5 (802.11ac)  

1. Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)
->Launched in 2014, operates only on 5 GHz.
->Max speed ~3.5 Gbps, uses 256-QAM.
-> Supports MU-MIMO (downlink only), no OFDMA.
-> Focused mainly on boosting speed.

2. Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)
->Released in 2019, works on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
->Max speed ~9.6 Gbps with 1024-QAM.
->Adds OFDMA and MU-MIMO for both directions.
->Target Wake Time (TWT) improves device battery life.
->Focuses on speed, capacity, and efficiency.

3. Wi-Fi 6E
->Extension of Wi-Fi 6 with the 6 GHz band.
->Offers more channels, reduced interference.
->Same tech upgrades (OFDMA, MU-MIMO, TWT).

4. Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)
->Works across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.
->Speeds > 40 Gbps with 4096-QAM and 320 MHz channels.
->Introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for parallel band use.
->Optimized for ultra-low latency and high-demand apps like AR/VR.
