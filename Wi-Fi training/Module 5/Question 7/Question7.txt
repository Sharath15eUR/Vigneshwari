7. Multi-Link Operation (MLO) and its impact on throughput and latency.
-> Multi-Link Operation (MLO) is a new feature in Wi-Fi 7 that allows devices to connect to multiple Wi-Fi bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) at the same time, instead of just one.
-> Impact:
a. Higher Throughput: By using several links together, data can move much faster, boosting overall speed.
b. Lower Latency: If one link gets busy or slow, data can quickly switch to another, making connections smoother and quicker.
c. More Reliable Connections: Reduces delays and keeps performance stable, even in crowded networks.
