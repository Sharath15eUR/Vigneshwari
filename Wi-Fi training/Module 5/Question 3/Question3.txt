3.Target wake time for IoT devices:

-> Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 helps devices, especially IoT devices, save battery life by scheduling exactly when they should wake up to send or receive data.
-> Benefits for IoT devices:
a. Longer battery life: Devices sleep longer and wake only when needed.
b. Less network congestion: Scheduled wake times avoid collisions and interference.
c. Better efficiency: Ideal for low-power devices like sensors, smart home gadgets, and wearables.
