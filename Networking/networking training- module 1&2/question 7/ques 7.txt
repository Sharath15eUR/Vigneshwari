Default gateway:
->When the source wants to reach a destination which is outside its network then, the source uses the default gateway to forward the data and locate the   destination’s network so that data should reach its intended destination.
-> It forwards the packet from client to other networks.
->It allows communication of computers on other networks.
->The default gateways are used when the host doesn’t know about the destination’s network .
->steps:
case : A laptop (192.168.1.100) wants to access Google (142.250.183.110).
a.The laptop does not know how to reach 142.250.183.110 directly, so it sends the request to the default gateway (192.168.1.1).
b.Default Gateway performs NAT and converts the private ip of the LAN into public ip.Now, the request goes to Google's servers.
c.The destination(google) responds and this response is received by the default gateway.
d.Default gateway again translates the public ip into private ip by NAT so that it reaches the laptops or PC successfully.

###To check if it is reachable or not :
We can use ping command with the default gateway to check connectivity.

vigneshwari-c@vigneshwari-c-VirtualBox:~$ ping -c 6 192.168.1.100
