Explain how a DHCP server assigns IP addresses to devices in your network.

->Every device that is part of a network needs a unique IP address to communicate with other network devices. These IP addresses are assigned either through Static IP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
->The DHCP follows a DORA process to assign IP addresses to the network devices. 
->This process is based on a client-server model.

->It involves an exchange of 4 types of messages:
a.Discover
b.Offer
c.Request
d.Acknowledgement

a.Discover:
When a device joins the network, it broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to find available DHCP servers through DHCPDISCOVER.This message is sent to 255.255.255.255 (broadcast address) since the client doesnâ€™t have an IP yet.

b.Offer:
The DHCP server receives the Discover request and offers an available IP from its IP pool by DHCPOFFER.This contains offered ip address,subnet mask,default gateway etc.

c.Request:
The client accepts the IP offer by sending a DHCP Request message back to the DHCP server through DHCPREQUEST.This message confirms that the client wants to use the offered IP.

d.Acknowledgement:
The DHCP server confirms the assignment with a DHCP Acknowledgment message by DHCPACK.

->Importance of DORA process:
a.Prevents IP conflicts
b.Ensures automatic IP assignment
