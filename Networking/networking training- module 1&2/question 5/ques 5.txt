5. Understand what happens when duplicate IPs configured in a network.

When two devices in a network are assigned the same IP address, it causes an IP address conflict.Here,
Both devices may lose network access 
Intermittent connectivity issues 
network instability.

Reasons for occurance:
1. Two systems sharing a same network,attempting to use same ip.
2.misconfiguration of static ip addresses, issued by DHCP server.
3.Manually assigning an ip which is in use to another system.

How can we detect?
1.by using ARP command.
When a device joins the network, it broadcasts an ARP request to check if the IP is in use.If another device responds with the same IP, a conflict is detected.
2. ip addr show : Here we can look for the duplicate ip's.
3.ping: if duplicate ip's persist then one system will respond and other drops packets leading to losses. 

How to overcome?
Identify the devices that are experiencing the conflict
Restart the devices and router.
If the problem persists, check the DHCP server settings to ensure it is properly assigning unique IP addresses. 
Assign a non-conflicting IP address to one of the devices
