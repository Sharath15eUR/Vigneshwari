Inter VLAN routing:
->Inter-VLAN routing allows communication between different VLANs using a router.
->Since Layer 2 switches cannot route traffic between VLANs, we use a Router-on-a-Stick configuration.
N/W setup:
->2 PC's
->A switch(2960)
->A router(2911)
Steps:
->I have configured a n/w using the above given components.
->First I have configured the switches and named VLAN10 and VLAN20.
->I conncted a trunk port with the router.
->Next, I configured the router.
->I verified their connectivity using the  ping command ( VLAN10(PC0)-> VLAN20(PC1)) and got successful replies.
