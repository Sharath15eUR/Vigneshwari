-> I have set up a Standard ACL to permit traffic from a specific IP range while blocking all other traffic using the same n/w setup usd in Question 10.
Steps:
-> IP Range to Allow: 192.168.10.0/24 (all devices in VLAN 10)
-> Deny All Other Traffic
->  Apply ACL to the Interface for Incoming Traffic
-> to achieve this i have configured the router with :
             Router(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255(Allows all devices in VLAN 10 (192.168.10.x).)
             Router(config)# access-list 10 deny any (denies others)
->I applied ACL on the router.

Observations:
->i used ping command to check the connectivity on PC0 and PC1. and got successful replies.
->But i tried to use telnet and ssh on the server it failed because we have blocked VLAN20 devices from accessing the VLAN10's service.
