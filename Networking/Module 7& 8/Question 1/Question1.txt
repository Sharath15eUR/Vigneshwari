Test-connection :
This command checks if a website is reachable.
nslookup:
This retrieves the IP address of the domain,i.e., finds the ip address of the website.

Steps:
-> I have executed the commands in the windows powershell.
->For verification purpose, I tried www.google.com
      Test-connection : I have verified this using the tracert command , if we can trace the destination.
      nslookup: I have manually typed the ip address in the chrome tab and it opens to the google page.
