-> Subnet dividing:
Given network: 10.0.0.0/24
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Binary representation : 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Here, the first 24 bits are for the network and the last 4 bits are assigned for the hosts.

In order to divide 4 equal subnets ,We need 2 additional bits which can be taken from the host position.thus it is now converted into 10.0.0.0/26
we require 2^2 = 4 subnets.
Thus ,the new subnet is :
      Binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
      Decimal: 255.255.255.192
For each subnet:
Subnet size: 2^(32 - 26) = 2^6 = 64 IPs
Usable hosts per subnet: 64 - 2 = 62 hosts.

Summary:
-> Subnet 1	
N/w address:10.0.0.0/26	
First host address:10.0.0.1	
Last host address:10.0.0.62	
Broadcast address:10.0.0.63
-> Subnet 2
N/w address:10.0.0.64/26	
First host address:10.0.0.65	
Last host address:10.0.0.126	
Broadcast address:10.0.0.127
-> Subnet 3
N/w address:10.0.0.128/26
First host address:10.0.0.129	
Last host address:10.0.0.190	
Broadcast address:10.0.0.191
-> Subnet 4	
N/w address:10.0.0.192/26	
First host address:10.0.0.193	
Last host address:10.0.0.254	
Broadcast address:10.0.0.255

Steps:
->First,using cisco packet tracer i configured a network using 2 routers,4 switches(1 switch /subnet),8 PC's.
->I configured the routers and using ip route, routed Router1 to subnet 3 and 4 and Router2 to subnet 1 and 2.
->I used ping command on PC0(subnet 1) to PC4(suubnet 3) and got successful replies.
->II found the packet's transfer path using tracert command.
