How NAT handles private ip?
->Private IP addresses are designated for local networks and cannot directly access the internet.
->Network Address Translation (NAT) enables devices with private IPs to connect to the internet by converting them into a public IP address.
Steps:
-> A device with a private IP attempts to access an external website, such as 8.8.8.8 
-> The router, configured with NAT, swaps the private IP with its own public IP.
-> The request is then sent over the internet to the destination IP.
-> When the response comes back, it is directed to the router's public IP.
-> NAT translates the public IP back to the original private IP and forwards the response to the correct device.
