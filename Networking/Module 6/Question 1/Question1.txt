ARP Protcol:
-> Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol used to map IP addresses  to MAC addresses within a network.
-> When a device needs to communicate with another device on the same network, it must know the recipient's MAC address. If the MAC address is unknown, ARP is used to find it.

Steps :
-> I opened Wireshark and chose the interface ( I chose Wifi as my interface).
-> In the command prompt , I used ping command of my router's IP .This forces the device to resolve the MAC address of the router.
-> Then in the filter coloumn I used arp to filter out only the arp protocol .
-> I used arp -a command in the cmd to displaty the arp table

How arp works: 
arp works by arp request and arp reply processes,below is the description of the two processes.
-> ARP Request (Broadcast)
* The router sends an ARP request packet to all devices in the local network.
* The request asks, "Who has IP 192.168.1.4? Tell 192.168.1.1."
* This is a broadcast message (sent to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
-> ARP Reply (Unicast)
* The device with the requested IP address responds with its MAC address.
* The reply is a unicast message sent directly to the requesting device.

Observations :
ARP request:
Opcode: request (1)
Source MAC : PhotonBroadb_e3:7e:a6 (00:18:93:e3:7e:a6)
Source ip address : 192.168.1.1
Destination MAC address: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)
Destination IP address: 192.168.1.4
Description: Who has 192.168.1.4? Tell 192.168.1.1

ARP reply:
Opcode: reply (2)
Source MAC address: Intel_d0:af:84 (b0:60:88:d0:af:84)
Source ip address : 192.168.1.4
Destination MAC address	: PhotonBroadb_e3:7e:a6 (00:18:93:e3:7e:a6)
Destination ip address :192.168.1.1
Description :192.168.1.4 is at b0:60:88:d0:af:84

Importance of arp in data forwarding:
-> When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it needs the MAC address of the recipient, not just the IP address.ARP facilitates this mapping by broadcasting a request to find the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
->ARP resolves IP to MAC address.
->When a device wants to send packets within a LAN, ARP finds the correct MAC address for the destination,thus enabling LAN Communication.
->It stores the MAC address in arp cache to reduce the network traffic.But arp caching can lead to malware attccks like arp spoofing.
->Without ARP, devices couldnâ€™t communicate in Ethernet-based LANs.
->ARP dynamically updates MAC addresses using ARP requests and replies.
