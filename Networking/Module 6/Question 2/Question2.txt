Routing:
->Routing is a process that shows how data packets are forwarded between different networks and devices.Routers are devices that perform routing.

->Here I used Static routing since it is easy to perform in simple procedures .In static routing, I explicitly defined the path that data packets should take from one network to another. 

Steps:
-> I used cisco packet tracer to setup a simple 2 LAN based systems comprising a router , 2 PC and a switch for each system.Both the routers arev connected using a copper crossover cable.
-> First I configured the router 5 and router 6 using the commands:
-> Router 5:
            enable
            configure terminal
            interface GigabitEthernet0/0
            ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
            no shutdown
            exit

-> Router 6:
            enable
            configure terminal
            interface GigabitEthernet0/0
            ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
            no shutdown
            exit
-> I used ip route command in Router5 to configure Static Route to 192.168.2.0/24 via Router6:
      ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2.
-> I used ip route command in Router6 to configure Static Route to 192.168.1.0/24 via Router6:
      ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
-> I configured the PC's of the two individual systems.
-> PC0
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
-> PC1
IP Address: 192.168.1.11
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
-> PC2
IP Address: 192.168.2.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
-> PC3
IP Address: 192.168.2.11
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
->I used ping command to check the connection between the PC's of system 1 and system 2.Here, I used ping command on PC0(System 1)  to PC2 on system 2 and got successful replies.
->I used ip route show command to show the routing tables of Router5 and Router6
->I used tracert command from PC0 to check the path to PC2.
->tracert command can show till 30 hops .I traced the route for my connection in 3 hops itself.
     192.168.1.1 (Router5) → The default gateway for PC0 
     10.0.0.2 (Router6) → Router5 forwards the packet to Router6 via the link between routers.
     192.168.2.10 (PC2) → Router6 sees that the destination is on its directly connected network (192.168.2.0/24) and forwards it to PC2.
-> Hence, I found the successful connection and proper packet forwarding.
