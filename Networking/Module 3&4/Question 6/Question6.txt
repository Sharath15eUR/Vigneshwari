Q6. Describe how you would configure a basic LAN interface using the ip command in Linux.

To configure a basic LAN interface in Linux using the ip command, the following steps are follwed:
->Check for interfaces:
  We need to check for  all the available interfaces, using the command:
                           ip link show

->To check whether the interface is up or down:
 We can check whether the required interface like enpos3,eth0 etc. are up or down.If its down we have to make that active, by giving the command
                        sudo ip link set enp0s3 up
 if it is enp0s3 is down , this command brings the enp0s3 ato active state

->To assign ip statically:
Next, I configure the network interface with a specific IP address. In this case, I assign 192.168.1.20 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 using the following command:
                        ip addr add 192.168.1.20/24 dev enp0s3

->Default gateway:
We can set the default gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.1) by using the command,
                  sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
         
->Verification : 
To check if the IP address and routes are set correctly, I used the commands, 
                        ip addr show enp0s3  
                        ip route show
  
-> Connectivity:
The connectivity can be checked using th ping command, which is:
                        ping 192.168.1.1
This setup ensures the LAN interface is properly configured for communication within the network
