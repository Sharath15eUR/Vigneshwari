Steps followed:
->First we are connecting a simple setup using a switch and 2 PC's.
->We are providing the ip address statically to both the systems.
on pinging for packet transfer, if the ip address is assigned correctly, then the packet reaches the destination without any packet loss.
->For checking purpose we are providing an incorrect ip, so the packet will not be deliverd rather it will be lost and request time out message pops up.
->we can use traceroute command:
         tracert <ip-address>
to check for the route the packets are transferred.It can trace upto 30 times.
->On providing a correct ip, the packet is delivered successfully and taking a single iteration if we execute with the tracert cmd.
