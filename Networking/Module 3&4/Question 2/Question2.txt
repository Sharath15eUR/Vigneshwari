Steps followed:
> I have created a small network setup using a PC and 3 switches.
> I have assigned ip to individual PC's :
      PC 1 : ip 192.168.10.1
      PC 2 : ip 192.168.10.2
      PC 3 : ip 192.168.10.3
> I started to capture the packets and analyzing it in Wireshark with ethernet as my interface.
> I used ping command in PC 1 for pinging PC2 and PC 1 to check for packet transfer.
> I have obtained the packet transfer window in wireshark.
