Steps followed:

Windows:
Assigning ip manually:
->In Cisco Packet Tracer, a simulation was set up with two PCs and one router.
->To assign a static IP, subnet mask, and gateway to each PC, click on the PC, navigate to the Desktop tab, and open IP Configuration.
->To configure the switch, access the CLI, enable the interfaces connected to the PCs.

Modifying MAC Address:
-> To change the MAC address of a PC, select the PC, go to the Config tab, and choose the network interface.
-> Modify the MAC address in the designated field.
-> The updated MAC address can be verified using the ipconfig /all command in the Command Prompt.

To check connectivity:
-> Use the ping command in the Command Prompt to test connectivity between PCs by sending packets to their IP addresses.
-> On the routerâ€™s CLI, the show interfaces brief command displays the status of connected devices and their interfaces.

Linux:
->First I used ifconfig command to display all the interfaces, then i used :
              sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
to assign the manual ip statically.
->Then i used 
             sudo ifconfig enpos3 hw ether 00:41:0B:5D:C8:95
to change the MAC address.
->The changed ip and MAC can be visualized using ifconfig enp0s3 command.
->Then I used ping to verify connectivity, on using the old ip the packet transmission is lost and on providing the current new ip the transmission takes place.
