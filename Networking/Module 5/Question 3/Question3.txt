Manually configure static IPs on the client devices(like Pc or your mobile phone) and verify connectivity using ping.
Static IP:
->A static IP address is a fixed, manually assigned IP address that does not change over time.
->Unlike a dynamic IP address, which is assigned automatically by a DHCP server and may change periodically, a static IP remains constant.

Steps:
-> Firt iam going to assign the static ip address in my windows using the following flow
     Control panel -> Network and Internet -> Network and sharing centre -> Change adapter setting
->From the list of available interfaces, I have chosen Wifi to be my interface.
-> After choosing Wifi, I have changed the TCP/IPv4 properties and assigned values like:
              Ipv4: 192.168.1.101
              Subnet:255.255.255.0
              Default Gateway:192.168.1.100
              DNS: 8.8.8.8
->After applying the chanegs, i moved to my windows cmd to check for it by using ipconfig command.
->To check the connectivity i used ping to connect to the default gateway and it showed proper transmission of the packets.
->I want to check whether the network is working or not so i used ping command to check for it.
            ping 192.168.1.101
-> I have got replies ensuring proper transmission without losses 

Difficulties:
-> when i tried to connect the DNS , ping 8.8.8.8 it failed ensuring that i have issues with the DNS.
