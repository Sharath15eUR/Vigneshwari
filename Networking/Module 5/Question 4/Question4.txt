DHCP:
-> ipconfig /release and ifconfig /renew is used to release the existng ip and add the new ip dynamically using DHCP.

DORA PROCESSES:
-> It consists of 4 processes:
    Discover
    Offer
    Request
    Acknowledgement
-> Discover (D) – The client sends a broadcast request (DHCP Discover) asking for an available IP address.
->Offer (O) – The DHCP server responds with an available IP address and other network details (DHCP Offer).
->Request (R) – The client sends a DHCP Request, confirming it wants the offered IP.
->Acknowledge (A) – The DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledge, confirming the lease and assigning the IP.
