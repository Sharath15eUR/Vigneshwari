ARP spoofing :
->ARP spoofing is a cyber attack that allows hackers to intercept communications between network devices on a network. Hackers can also use ARP spoofing to alter or block all traffic between devices on the network.

Steps:
->I have created a simple system comprising of 2 PC's connected to a switch which in turn is connected to a router.
->I have assigned static ip to all the individual components.
->To assign static ip to switch:
       enable
       configure terminal
       interface vlan 1  
       ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 
       no shutdown  
       exit
       write memory 
->To assign static ip to router:
   enable
   configure terminal
   interface gigabitEthernet 0/1  
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 
   no shutdown  
   exit
   write memory  
->Now change the MAC address of the router to the attcker PC.
->ping PC1 to the router.
->observe the arp table using arp -a.

Observations:
->On normal pinging, the packet transfer happens between the victim and the router.
->On modifying the MAC of the router with the attcker's MAC address, The transfer happens between attcker PC and the victim PC.
->Victim PC assumes that the data transfer is happening between it and router but the data is transferred to different estination casing malware attack.
->This can be visualized using the arp table.
