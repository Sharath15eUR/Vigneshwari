ARP protocol:
-> ARP stands for “Address Resolution Protocol”. It is a network protocol used to determine the MAC address (hardware address) from any IP address.
-> This protocol is used when a device wants to communicate with another device over a local area network or ethernet.
-> It is a network layer protocol.

Process:
When a sender wants to communicate, it first checks its ARP cache for the receiver's MAC address.  
- If found, communication proceeds using that MAC.  
- If not, the sender broadcasts an ARP request with its own MAC/IP, leaving the receiver’s MAC blank.  
- All devices on the LAN receive this request, but only the device with the matching IP responds with an ARP reply, providing its MAC address.  
- The sender updates its ARP cache and can now communicate directly.

Steps:
->I have created a simple network consisting of 2 PC's and a ethernet switch.
->I have statically given them  the ip address of 192.168.1.1/24 and 192.168.1.2/24.
->I started to capture packets using wireshark.
->In the PC 1's console i used ping 192.168.1.2 command to capture the packets.
->I applied the arp filter in wireshark to filter out only the ones with  arp protocol.

Terms:
1. ARP Request Frame:
Sender MAC: The MAC address of the device sending the request.
Sender IP: The IP address of the sender asking for the MAC address.
Target MAC: Set to 00:00:00:00:00:00 (unknown).
Target IP: The IP address of the destination device whose MAC is being requested.
Broadcast MAC: Sent to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (broadcast) to reach all devices on the network.
2. ARP Reply Frame:
Sender MAC: The MAC address of the responding device.
Sender IP: The IP address of the responding device.
Target MAC: The MAC address of the original sender.
Target IP: The IP address of the sender who made the request.
Unicast MAC: Sent directly to the requester’s MAC address.


Observations:

->ARP Request:
Sender MAC & IP: PC1 asks, "Who has 192.168.1.2? Tell 192.168.1.1".
Target MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (broadcast).
->ARP Reply:
Sender MAC & IP: PC2 responds, "192.168.1.2 is at 00:50:79:66:68:01".
Target MAC: PC1's MAC.
This packet is unicast (sent directly to PC1).
